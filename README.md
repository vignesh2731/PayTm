📌 Description: This is a full-stack Paytm Clone application built using Turborepo to manage a monorepo structure, allowing efficient code sharing between frontend and backend. The primary goal of the project is to understand and simulate real-world digital payment flows, including netbanking-based transactions and peer-to-peer (P2P) payments.

The project emulates essential Paytm-like features including:

🔐 User Authentication

💰 Wallet Balance Management

🔄 P2P Money Transfers

🏦 Netbanking-style Bank Transfers

📜 Transaction History

🔗 Simulated UPI-style Payment Flow

🏗️ Tech Stack: Turborepo – Monorepo architecture for seamless integration of backend, frontend, and shared utilities

Next.js  – For building dynamic, modern frontend

Node.js / Express  – For backend API routes and business logic

PostgreSQL  – Database to store user data and transaction logs

Prisma / ORM – For type-safe database access

Tailwind CSS – For clean and responsive UI design
